News Cards
The news cards are implemented in a way that ensures smooth scalability. If additional cards are added, a slider with navigation is automatically enabled. All text, images, and titles are constrained to predefined limits, ensuring that the layout remains intact regardless of content length.

An "expand text" feature has also been implemented, allowing users to reveal the full text of a card. If one card is already expanded and another is opened, the first card will collapse automatically. This behavior is synchronized with the slider as well: when a swipe action is performed, any expanded card will automatically collapse.

Reset and Fonts
The reset and font styles are combined into a single file to minimize the number of HTTP requests, which helps improve page loading performance.
